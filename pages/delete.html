  <h1>Delete a Resource with curl</h1>
  <p>To delete a resource on this server, use the following curl command in your terminal:</p>
  <pre>curl -X DELETE ip:port/path_to_file"</pre>
  <p>For example: curl -X DELETE localhost:400/pages/uploads/test.txt</p>
  <p>Replace "Your/Requested/Path.resource" with the actual path to the resource you want to delete.</p>
  <p>**Important:** Sending a DELETE request permanently removes a resource. Use it with caution!</p>
  <p>Note: Html forms aren't compatible with sending delete requests. This is why we use curl.</p>
